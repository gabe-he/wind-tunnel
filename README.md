# Wind Tunnel Project

A wind tunnel is a device that produces a controlled stream of air to study how objects interact with airflow, for exploring the principles of aerodynamics.

This project aims to build an accessible, modular educational wind tunnel that can be easily transported and assembled, allowing demonstrations in classrooms, community centers, and public events. By bringing this interactive learning tool to underserved and low-income students, the project seeks to spark curiosity, deepen understanding of science, and inspire the next generation of innovators.

This repository provides **all resources** related to the wind tunnel project — from planning and design to implementation and analysis. It is intended as a **comprehensive educational package** for anyone interested in building and studying a small-scale aerodynamic experiment. By sharing our design, data, and methods openly, I hope to make hands-on science learning more engaging and approachable for students, educators, and enthusiasts alike.

## Features

* Modular design, can be disassembled for easy transportation
* Adjustable wing angle
* Adjustable airflow speed
* Lift/Drag measurement to measure the lift/drag
* Smoke generator for clear visualization of streamlines
* Demonstrates fundamentals of aerodynamic lift and drag
  * Role of angle of attack in lift generation
  * How flow separation causes stall
  * Visual comparison of laminar vs turbulent flow
